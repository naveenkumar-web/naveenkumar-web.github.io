    Create a directory/folder where you want to manage your site. I created mine in Documents/myWork/projects/Portfolio.
    After doing so, launch your terminal/command prompt and clone your remote/online repository to your local machine (in the directory that you created) by running the following command;

 git clone https://github.com/brianmwevi/brianmwevi.github.io.git

NB: Remember to replace the URL with your own.

6. Copy the contents of your downloaded template into the cloned repository directory. Make sure the index.html file is at the root of this directory.

7. Change directory (cd) into the cloned repository and run the following commands respectively pressing enter after each

git add -Agit commit -m “Initial Commit”git push origin master

Enter the username and password when prompted after running the last command.

8. Navigate to http://naveenm.github.io (http://naveenm.github.io) to see your newly created online portfolio.
